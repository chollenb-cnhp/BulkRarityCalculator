    "This script imports a .csv file with rows containing multi-species point occurrence data and WGS84 lat,lon coordinates. The output is a xlsx file containing extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), number of hypothetical EOs, and calculated rarity rank. This enables multi-species calculations which are not currently possible on GeoCAT. The projection coordinate system matches the .prj file from the EOO toolbox provided by IUCN. Calculated values match those of the toolbox, but may differ from GeoCAT by 1% at larger scales.\n",
